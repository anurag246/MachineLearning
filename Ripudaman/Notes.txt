#1. Some points for discussion:-

1.Mean = sun of data points / number of data points N

2. squareDiff = (datapoint -mean) square

3. variance = Sum of squqred diff / N

for sample variance = Sum of squqred diff / N-1

4. Std deviation = square root of variance

Plus , minus of SD will give you range and tell you how much data could deviate from its mean!

- the close it is to zero the less variance and the less SD.

- the higer the number more SD, the more volatile the data will be , more unpredictible.
